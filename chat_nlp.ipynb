th endment had a loophole that allowed slavery for prisoners because in s they still wanted a justification for exploiting free labor from black people  from that incentive emerged the prison industrial complex which has a history of mass incarceration (and extending sentences for minor offenses) in order to get free prisoner slave labor  private prisons often lobby politicians because they profit off the free slave labor (dont tell me that has nothing to do with capitalism) so they kinda let it happen  thats what kala harris was legendarily fled for this in the primary debate by tulsi gabbard (before tulsi bece a goddn republican \\n*\\n*\\n) bc she let prisoners stay in way longer how kala harris fought to keep nonviolent prisoners locked upprospect orgtheres a great

back  everyone do their dishes  i put the utensil rack on the counter  so put them there when u clean them  the drying station is also not a permanent place to store dishes  this is what was happening and there was rice and grime caked over our clean dishes  put the dishes away once theyre dried  and whoever left their green take out tub with rice in it sitting on the counter  that was nasty as fuck and smelt like shit  clean it before u leave for break please alr thats all  i love you boys  enjoy the rest of ur break  lets just keep our home clean    lets just keep our home clean    SAMMY

believe the load of crap is on the toilet all yall do is talk about how we should be living cleaner but nobody does anything replies DAVID  how is that possiblei ce back this morning and the trash can literally reeked i cant believe nobody noticed thathow tf would i know how its possiblebut its thereall yall do is talk about how we should be living cleaner but nobody does anything replies SAMMY ok this i agree with  i feel like we should do the suitemate agreement again and then somehow make it binding i cant believe that yall motherfuckers dont know how to live without leaving a pile of shit for everything you donot flushing the toilet properly and shitting outside of it is unacceptable not doing the dishes for days on end is unacceptable  DAVIS can someone please send a picture of the shit on the toilet i want to see what happened  im going to class rn so i cant honestly theres more tho DAVIS okay well someone send a picture please before you clean itfor me personally  leaving food in the cabinet or the fridge for weeks and it going bad is unacceptable ive thrown out sm foodi also think that just leaving food and your personal belongings on the countertops in unacceptable because everytime i sit down i have to move stuff aroundin the com area i mean do whatever u want in ur roomsi feel like weve had these conversations before about how this shit is fucked up and we need to do better but ive given up being the only one whos trying to actually enforce itall yall do is talk about how we should be living cleaner but nobody does anything replies SAMMY ok but we gotta focus on solutions  everyone agrees status quo unacceptable  status quo unacceptable so we gotta come up with a system  VAIBHAV stopped putting effort in tryna enforce it cuz nothing changes when i get on peoples asses SAMMY how about we create a venmo account in which for every day a dish is left unwashed the person must add another dollar and at end of semester it gets split seven ways i want to be able to live in a clean place and i think thats my right and i think that if need be i should be able to tell people off without being leveled as an asshole or the fucking uptight one of the group SAMMY who labels u uptight tho  me being used when ur not isnt the se as thinking ur out of line i doubt anyone thinks ur wrong here regardlesshow about we create a venmo account in which for every day a dish is left unwashed the person must add another dollar and at end of semester it gets split seven ways im really surprised that all of us adults should need something like this to be able to be mature clean and respectful of others in the living space SAMMY well…  surprise” im not against it but ill be really disappointed if we cant just fucking clean up after ourselves just fucking clean up after ourselves replieswell…  surprise” what the fuck is wrong with you SAMMY we are not currently clean thus ur making speculative statements about determined outcomes  it turns out… we suck  therefore we need more or something yeah but maybe its enough if the people who are unclean  and we all know who were talking about  just grow a spine and get in linei dont think its that hardwere adults and we should act like itim not against it but ill be really disappointed if we cant just fucking clean up after ourselves repliesactually i  against iti changed my mindi dont want to live with people who arent mature enough to clean up after themselves without some kind of lure like this DAVID ah the toilet was just facilities when they uncloggrd the toilet ill clean it cause it was my fault suite trashdocs google comaite i made a doc for trash duty because we didnt have an actual orderany time we see a single dish in the sink we should figure out who it is and she them  VAIBHAV the bowls and spoons currently in the sink are from the night we smokedme personally i only had food that was disposable and the one spooon i used to eat ice cre was washed since i used that se spoon this morningtue  dec     i apologize for my rude words earlier today  i try to stay cordial but sometimes when i lose my temper i cant  but i meant what i meant  especially cuz i ce back today and the dishes were still in the sink and the toilet wasnt flushed properly  if im being honest though im giving up on us trying to actually live cleanly and respectfully to others in the living space  particularly me because apparently only this bothers me that much  i may strive for a strict way of living but i dont think im asking for much by checking to make sure you leave the bathroom the way you found it and you rinse your dish when youre done with it  it takes like a couple seconds but ok  idk if this is a joke to you guys but its not to me  i didnt envision my living space being like this even tho im living with my friends  tbh im just gonna give up on the expectation because at least that way im not disappointed  you guys are free to live how you want as long as you dont use

flushinglike a double digit number of occasions replies VAIBHAV  strongly disagree SAMMY okay sure but i did nothing wrong this time  VAIBHAV do you think not flushing isnt wrong SAMMY i think it is inconsiderate; the habit started because i thought pissing on my own piss when my brother left would save water thro flushes but i recognize that other people find that very distasteful and its a rude thing to do in a suite environment   but id say its a function of my absent mindedness not my intention so i  sorry cuz i dont think its right but i dont know how to forget less even tho thats not an excuse  VAIBHAV i understand you arent intending to make a suite environment where ur suite mates are disgusted but thats sorta a given cuz ur not as assholethe issue i have is its been brought up
